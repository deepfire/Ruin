* Generalise tool preferences

  Right now, the set of preferences is represented by a single ToolKind value.

  It ought to be:

  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  (Type f, Type t, ToolKind tk) => HashMap (f, t) tk
  #+END_SRC

  Right now, there's an assortment of contexts:

  - Component
  - Buildable
  - Chain
  - Tool
  - Context

  They're all passed around separately and rather unprofitably.
